golo
====

Inspired by [goli](https://bitbucket.org/jatone/gilo) (reverse search the path) looking for a .gopath file in order
to set Go's GOPATH and then execute the command.

In this implementation I am going to eliminate the use of all 3rd party libs. Given
this function's usefulness I do not believe there is a good reason to import
as many dependencies as the gilo developer did.

While the project gilo project was an inspiration I like golo as a name to mean
GO LOcal.  Where lo is already an alias for local.
